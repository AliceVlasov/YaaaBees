# SDP Group 22 Repo

## How to use:
See Setup_overview.txt for how the valves and the motors should be connected to the motorboard and the Main.py files which run our demo for the leg and for the cube.

To change the hardcoded timing/pressure thresholds for inflating and deflating the silicone pouches, look in the init functions of Safe_Controller and Cube_Controller.

If an error occurs and the pumps or valves do not turn off correctly, run emergency.py.

Air.py has all the hardware-control functionality.

See https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1iiNrprrmitW4A5fImg711Zits6A8UIad0X0ZcEftsuo/edit?usp=sharing for valve connections (may need to double-check that this is correct).
